# openui5-flatpickr

openui5-flatpickr is a SAPUI5 Custom Control that wraps [flatpickr Date Picker](https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr)

![flatpickr example with time support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StErMi/openui5-flatpickr/master/example/openui5-flatpickr-demo/webapp/images/openui5_flatpickr.png)

## Demo

You can checkout a demo with different configurations here: https://stermi.github.io/openui5-flatpickr/example/openui5-flatpickr-demo/webapp/

## Usage

### Configure manifest.json

Add the library to sap.ui5 dependencies list and configure the resourceRoots to point where you uploaded the custom library.

```json
"sap.ui5": {
    ...
	"dependencies": {
		"minUI5Version": "1.30.0",
		"libs": {
    		...
			"it.designfuture.flatpickr": {}
		}
	},
	"resourceRoots": {
		"it.designfuture.flatpickr": "./thirdparty/it/designfuture/flatpickr/"
	}
}
```

### Add the custom control inside an XML View

First of all add the namespace 

```xml
xmlns:df="it.designfuture.flatpickr"
```

And than you can simply add it a simple Input (FlatDatePicker extends InputBase)

```xml
<df:FlatDatePicker 
  class="sapUiMediumMargin"
  clickOpens="false"
  dateFormat="d/m/Y"
/>
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Default| Description
| :---- | :------------------- | :---- | :---------  |
| altFormat | string | "F j, Y" | Exactly the same as date format, but for the altInput field
| altInput | boolean | false | Show the user a readable date (as per altFormat), but return something totally different to the server
| altInputClass | string | "" | This class will be added to the input element created by the altInput option. Note that altInput already inherits classes from the original input
| allowInput | boolean | false | Allows the user to enter a date directly input the input field. By default, direct entry is disabled
| clickOpens | boolean | false | Whether clicking on the input should open the picker. You could disable this if you wish to open the calendar manually with.open()
| dateFormat | string | "Y-m-d" | A string of characters which are used to define how the date will be displayed in the input box. The supported characters are defined in the table below.
| dateValue | object | null | Set the initial selected date. Same as preloading a date string into an input's value attribute, but can also handle a Date object
| disableMobile | boolean | false | Set disableMobile to true to always use the non-native picker. By default, Flatpickr utilizes native datetime widgets unless certain options (e.g. disable) are used
| enableTime | boolean | false | Enables time picker
| enableSeconds | boolean | false | Enables seconds in the time picker
| hourIncrement | int | 1 | Adjusts the step for the hour input (incl. scrolling)
| inline | boolean | false | Displays the calendar inline
| maxDate | object | null | The maximum date that a user can pick to (inclusive).
| minDate | object | null | The minimum date that a user can start picking from (inclusive)
| minuteIncrement | int | 5 | Adjusts the step for the minute input (incl. scrolling)
| mode | string | "single" | "single", "multiple", or "range"
| noCalendar | boolean | false | Hides the day selection in calendar. Use it along with enableTime to create a time picker
| shorthandCurrentMonth | boolean | false | Show the month using the shorthand version (ie, Sep instead of September)
| static | boolean | false | Position the calendar inside the wrapper and next to the input element. (Leave false unless you know what you're doing.)
| time_24hr | boolean | false | Displays time picker in 24 hour mode without AM/PM selection when enabled
| utc | boolean | false | When true, dates will parsed, formatted, and displayed in UTC. It's recommended that date strings contain the timezone, but not necessary
| weekNumbers | boolean | false | Enables display of week numbers in calendar

## Events

| Name |  Description
| :---- | :------------------- |
| onChange | onChange gets triggered when the user selects a date, or changes the time on a selected date
| onOpen | onOpen gets triggered when the calendar is opened
| onClose | onClose gets triggered when the calendar is closed
| onMonthChange | onMonthChange gets triggered when the month is changed, either by the user or programmatically
| onYearChange | onYearChange gets triggered when the year is changed, either by the user or programmatically
| onReady | onReady gets triggered once the calendar is in a ready state
| onValueUpdate | onValueUpdate gets triggered when the input value is updated with a new date string
| onDayCreate | Take full control of every date cell with the onDayCreate() hook

## Methods

| Name |  Description
| :---- | :------------------- |
| clear | Resets the selected dates (if any) and clears the input

| destroy | Destroys the Flatpickr instance, cleans up - removes event listeners, restores inputs, etc
| formatDate | Return a formatted date
| jumpToDate | Sets the calendar view to the year and month ofdate, which can be a date string, a Date, or nothing. If date is undefined, the view is set to the latest selected date, the minDate, or today’s date

| getSelectedDates | Return an array with selected dates

## Build

If you would like to extend and customize the controllr, you can easily do that but re-building the code with just a simple Grunt command:

```
grunt build
```

You just need to take note of two things:

 1. **compatVersion**: you should type here your project SAPUI5 version. Old projects (1.28.x) will generate a *library-preload.json*, new version will instead create a *library-prelaod.js*
 2. **openui5_theme**: add addictional files for each theme you are supporting in your application
